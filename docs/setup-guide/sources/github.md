## Prerequisites

## Setup guide

### Step 1: Obtain GitHub personal access token (skip this step for OAuth authentication)

1. Sign in to your GitHub account.

2. Go to Settings -> Developer settings -> [Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) page.

3. Click **Generate new token**, select **scopes** which define the access for the token, and click **Generate token**.

  > NOTE: Your token should have at least the `repo` scope. Depending on which streams you want to sync, the user generating the token needs more permissions:
  > * For syncing Collaborators, the user which generates the personal access token must be a collaborator. To become a collaborator, they must be invited by an owner. If there are no collaborators, no records will be synced. Read more about access permissions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/access-permissions-on-github).
  > * For syncing [Teams](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams) is only available to authenticated members of a team's organization. Personal user accounts and repositories belonging to them don't have access to Teams features. In this case no records will be synced.
  > * For syncing Projects, the repository must have the Projects feature enabled.

4. Save your access token for later use.

### Step 2: Set up GitHub in Daspire

1. Select **GitHub** from the Source list.

2. Enter a **Source Name**.

3. For **Authentication**, choose one of the following:

  > * For **OAuth** authentication, click **Authenticate your GitHub account** and sign in to your GitHub account.
  > * For **Personal Access Token** authentication, enter the Personal Access Token you obtained in Step 1. To load balance your API quota consumption across multiple API tokens, input multiple tokens separated with `,`.

4. **GitHub Repositories** - Enter a list of GitHub organizations/repositories, e.g. `daspirehq/daspire` for single repository, `daspirehq/daspire` `daspirehq/another-repo` for multiple repositories. If you want to specify the organization to receive data from all its repositories, then you should specify it according to the following example: `daspirehq/*`.

  > CAUTION: Repositories with the wrong name or repositories that do not exist or have the wrong name format will be skipped.

5. **Start Date and Time** - The date from which you'd like to replicate data from GitHub in the format `YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00Z`. Only data generated on or after the start date will be replicated.

  > * These streams will only sync records generated on or after the Start Date: `comments`, `commit_comment_reactions`, `commit_comments`, `commits`, `deployments`, `events`, `issue_comment_reactions`, `issue_events`, `issue_milestones`, `issue_reactions`, `issues`, `project_cards`, `project_columns`, `projects`, `pull_request_comment_reactions`, `pull_requests`, `pull_requeststats`, `releases`, `review_comments`, `reviews`, `stargazers`, `workflow_runs`, `workflows`.
  > * The Start Date does not apply to the streams below and all data will be synced for these streams: `assignees`, `branches`, `collaborators`, `issue_labels`, `organizations`, `pull_request_commits`, `pull_request_stats`, `repositories`, `tags`, `teams`, `users`

6. **Branch** (Optional) - List of GitHub repository branches to pull commits from, e.g. `daspirehq/daspire/main`. If no branches are specified for a repository, the default branch will be pulled.

7. **Page Size for Large Streams** (Optional) - The Github integration contains several streams with a large amount of data. The page size of such streams depends on the size of your repository. We recommended that you specify values between 10 and 30.

8. Click **Save & Test**.

### Notes

1. Only 4 streams (`comments`, `commits`, `issues` and `review comments`) from the listed above streams are pure incremental meaning that they:

  > * read only new records;
  > * output only new records.

2. Streams `workflow_runs` and `worflow_jobs` is almost pure incremental:

  > * read new records and some portion of old records (in past 30 days);
  > * the `workflow_jobs` depends on the `workflow_runs` to read the data, so they both follow the same logic docs;
  > * output only new records.

3. Other 19 incremental streams are also incremental but with one difference, they:

  > * read all records;
  > * output only new records. Please, consider this behaviour when using those 19 incremental streams because it may affect you API call limits.

4. Sometimes for large streams specifying very distant `start_date` in the past may result in keep on getting error from GitHub instead of records. In this case Specifying more recent `start_date` may help. The "Start date" configuration option does not apply to the streams below, because the GitHub API does not include dates which can be used for filtering:

  > * `assignees`
  > * `branches`
  > * `collaborators`
  > * `issue_labels`
  > * `organizations`
  > * `pull_request_commits`
  > * `pull_request_stats`
  > * `repositories`
  > * `tags`
  > * `teams`
  > * `users`

## Performance consideration & Troubleshooting

1. The GitHub integration should not run into GitHub API limitations under normal usage. Refer to GitHub article [Rate limits for the REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api).

2. Max number of tables that can be synced at a time is 6,000. We advise you to adjust your settings if it fails to fetch schema due to max number of tables reached.

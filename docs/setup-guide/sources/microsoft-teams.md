## Prerequisites

* An Azure account that has an active subscription

The [Microsoft Graph API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview) uses OAuth for authentication. Microsoft Graph exposes granular permissions that control the access that apps have to resources, like users, groups, and mail. When a user signs in to your app they, or, in some cases, an administrator, are given a chance to consent to these permissions. If the user consents, your app is given access to the resources and APIs that it has requested. For apps that don't take a signed-in user, permissions can be pre-consented to by an administrator when the app is installed.

Microsoft Graph has two types of permissions:

* **Delegated permissions** are used by apps that have a signed-in user present. For these apps, either the user or an administrator consents to the permissions that the app requests, and the app can act as the signed-in user when making calls to Microsoft Graph. Some delegated permissions can be consented by non-administrative users, but some higher-privileged permissions require administrator consent.

* **Application permissions** are used by apps that run without a signed-in user present; for example, apps that run as background services or daemons. Application permissions can only be consented by an administrator. This source requires **Application permissions**.

## Setup guide

### Step 1: Obtain Microsoft Teams crendentials

Follow these [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-v2-service?context=graph%2Fapi%2F1.0&view=graph-rest-1.0) or the below steps for creating an app in the Azure portal. This process will produce the `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `tenant_id` needed to set up the source in Daspire.

1. Login to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home).

2. Select **Microsoft Entra ID** from list Azure services, or search for it in the search bar.

4. Register an application. Enter a name for your app, and in Supported account types, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**. Cick the Register button.

5. You will be directed to your App's Overview page. From there, copy the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID**. You will use them later for authentication in Daspire.

6. Click **Add a certificate or secret**, which will open the Certificates & secrets page.

7. Click **+ New client secret**. In the opened pop up, provide a description for the client secret and select the expirary duration that suits your need. Then click Add.

8. Copy the client secret **Value**. You will use it later for authentication in Daspire.

### Step 2: Set up Microsoft Teams  in Daspire

1. Select **Microsoft Teams** from the Source list.

2. Enter a **Source Name**.

3. For **Authentication**, choose one of the following:

    * For **OAuth** authentication:

4. For **Period**, the supported values are: `D7`, `D30`, `D90`, and `D180`. Specifies the length of time over which the Team Device Report stream is aggregated.

5. Click **Save & Test**.

## Data type mapping

| Integration Type | Daspire Type |
| --- | --- |
| `string` | `string` |
| `number` | `number` |
| `array` | `array` |
| `object` | `object` |

## Performance consideration & Troubleshooting

1. Rate limit: This integration is restricted by normal [Microsoft Graph requests limitation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/throttling).

2. Max number of tables that can be synced at a time is 6,000. We advise you to adjust your settings if it fails to fetch schema due to max number of tables reached.

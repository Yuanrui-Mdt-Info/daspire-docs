# Zencart

This page contains the setup guide and reference information for Zencart.

## Sync overview

Zencart runs on a MySQL database. You can use Daspire to sync your Zencart instance by connecting to the underlying MySQL database and leveraging the [MySQL source](./mysql.md).

  > **Note:** Reach out to your system admin to find the parameters required to connect to the underlying database

## Output schema

The output schema is the same as that of the Zencart Database described [here](https://docs.zen-cart.com/dev/schema/).

## Setup guide

### Step 1: Obtain Plaid setup details

1. **Visit your [Plaid dashboard](https://dashboard.plaid.com/overview):** Click **Keys** from the **Team Settings** dropdown.
![Plaid Keys](/assets/images/plaid-keys.jpg "Plaid Keys")

2. **Get Client id and API key:** On the Keys page, copy your **client_id** and Sandbox **secret**.
![Plaid Client Id Secret](/assets/images/plaid-client-id-secret.jpg "Plaid Client Id Secret")

3. **Create an Access Token:** First you have to create a public token key and then you can create an access token.

* **Create public key:** Make this API call described in [Plaid docs](https://plaid.com/docs/api/sandbox/#sandboxpublic_tokencreate)
```
curl --location --request POST 'https://sandbox.plaid.com/sandbox/public_token/create' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-16' \
  --data-raw '{
      "client_id": "<your-client-id>",
      "secret": "<your-sandbox-api-key>",
      "institution_id": "ins_43",
      "initial_products": ["auth", "transactions"]
  }'
```

* **Exchange public key for access token:** Make this API call described in [Plaid docs](https://plaid.com/docs/api/tokens/#itempublic_tokenexchange). The public token used in this request, is the token returned in the response of the previous request.
```
curl --location --request POST 'https://sandbox.plaid.com/item/public_token/exchange' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-16' \
  --data-raw '{
      "client_id": "<your-client-id>",
      "secret": "<your-sandbox-api-key>",
      "public_token": "<public-token-returned-by-previous-request>"
  }'
```

## Performance considerations

The Plaid connector should not run into Stripe API limitations under normal usage. Please [contact us](mailto:support@daspire.com) if you see any rate limit issues that are not automatically retried successfully.

## Troubleshooting

Max number of tables that can be synced at a time is 6,000. We advise you to adjust your settings if it fails to fetch schema due to max number of tables reached.

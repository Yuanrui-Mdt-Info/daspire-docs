## Setup guide

### Step 1: Create an integration in Notion​

1. Log in to your Notion workspace and navigate to the [My integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations) page.

2. Click **+ New integration**.

  > NOTE: You must be the owner of the Notion workspace to create a new integration.

3. Enter a Name for your integration. Make sure you have selected the correct workspace from the Associated workspace dropdown menu, and click **Submit**.

4. Inside the integration you just created, click **Capabilities** from the left sidebar. Check the following capabilities based on your use case:

  > * Read content: required for all connections.
  > * Read comments: required if you wish to sync the Comments stream
  > * Read user information (either with or without emails): required if you wish to sync the Users stream

### Step 2: Make your integration public and obtain credentials

#### Using OAuth 2.0

1. Inside the integration you just created, click **Distribution** from the left sidebar, and toggle the switch to make the integration **public**.

2. Fill out the required fields in the **Organization** information and **OAuth Domain & URIs** section.

3. Once you click Submit after filling out all the required field, you will be directed to the **Secrets** tab. Copy your **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Authorization URL**.

4. You need to use your integration's **Authorization URL** to set the necessary page permissions and send a request to obtain your **Access Token**. A thorough explanation of the necessary steps is provided in the official [Notion documentation](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#public-integration-auth-flow-set-up).

5. You're ready to set up Notion in Daspire!

#### Using Access Token

If you are authenticating via Access Token, you will need to manually share each page you want to sync with Daspire.

1. Navigate to the page(s) you want to sync with Daspire. Click the **•••** menu at the top right of the page, scroll down to **Add connections**, and choose the integration you created in Step 1.

2. Once you have done that to all the pages you want to sync, go back to your integration, and copy the **Access Token** from the **Secrets** tab.

3. You're ready to set up Notion in Daspire!

### Step 3: Set up Notion in Daspire

1. Select **Notion** from the Source list.

2. Enter a **Source Name**.

3. Copy and paste the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Access Token** you acquired after setting up your public integration.

4. (Optional) You may optionally provide a **Start Date** in the format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ`. When using incremental syncs, only data generated after this date will be replicated. If left blank, Airbyte will set the start date two years from the current date by default.

5. Click **Save & Test**.

## Output schema

This Source is capable of syncing the following core Streams:

* [Blocks](https://developers.notion.com/reference/retrieve-a-block)
* [Comments](https://developers.notion.com/reference/retrieve-a-comment)
* [Databases](https://developers.notion.com/reference/retrieve-a-database)
* [Pages](https://developers.notion.com/reference/retrieve-a-page)
* [Users](https://developers.notion.com/reference/get-users)

## Data type mapping

| Integration Type | Daspire Type |
| --- | --- |
| `string` | `string` |
| `number` | `number` |
| `array` | `array` |
| `object` | `object` |

## Performance considerations

The integration is restricted by Notion [request limits](https://developers.notion.com/reference/request-limits). The Notion integration should not run into Notion API limitations under normal usage.

## Troubleshooting

Max number of tables that can be synced at a time is 6,000. We advise you to adjust your settings if it fails to fetch schema due to max number of tables reached.

## Data type mapping

| --- | --- |
| `string` | `string` |
| `number` | `number` |
| `array` | `array` |
| `object` | `object` |

## Performance considerations

PayPal transaction API has some [limits](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/integration/direct/transaction-search/):

* `start_date_min` = 3 years, API call lists transaction for the previous three years.
* `start_date_max` = 1.5 days, it takes a maximum of three hours for executed transactions to appear in the list transactions call. It is set to 1.5 days by default based on experience, otherwise API throw an error.
* `stream_slice_period` = 7 day, the maximum supported date range is 31 days.
* `records_per_request` = 10000, the maximum number of records in a single request.
* `page_size` = 500, the maximum page size is 500.
* `requests_per_minute` = 30, maximum limit is 50 requests per minute from IP address to all endpoint

By default, syncs are performed with a slice period of `7 days`. If you see errors with the message `Result set size is greater than the maximum limit. Change the filter criteria and try again.`, lower the size of the slice period in your source configuration.

## Troubleshooting

Max number of tables that can be synced at a time is 6,000. We advise you to adjust your settings if it fails to fetch schema due to max number of tables reached.

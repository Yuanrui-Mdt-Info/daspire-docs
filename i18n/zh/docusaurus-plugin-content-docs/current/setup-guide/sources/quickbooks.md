## Setup guide

### Step 1: Create a QuickBooks Application

1. Create an [Intuit Developer account](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/get-started)

2. Visit your **Intuit Developer Dashboard**.

3. Click **Create an application**, give your app a name, and select the scopes of the APIs you would like to access.

### Step 2: Obtain QuickBooks credentials

1. The easiest way to get these credentials is by using [Quickbook's OAuth 2.0 playground](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/develop/authentication-and-authorization/oauth-2.0-playground).

2. From the **Select app** dropdown, select one of your **sandbox** companies. Copy your **Client Id** and **Client Secret**. You will use them when creating the source in Daspire.

3. In the **Scopes** section, select one or more scopes.

4. Click **Get authorization code**. If asked, select Connect to connect your app to the OAuth Playground.

5. Review and copy the auto-generated **Authorization code** and **Realm ID**. The authorization code is based on your appâ€™s scopes.

6. Click **Get tokens**. Copy the **Access Token**, **Refresh Token**, and **Realm ID**.

7. Review the sample request and response.

### Step 3: Set up QuickBooks in Daspire

1. Enter the **Client ID** - The OAuth2.0 application ID you obtained in Step 2.

2. Enter the **Client Secret** - The OAuth2.0 application secret you obtained in Step 2.

3. Enter the **Refresh Token** you obtained in Step 2.

4. Enter the **Access Token** you obtained in Step 2.

5. Enter the **Token Expiry Date** - DateTime when the access token becomes invalid.

6. Enter the **Realm ID** - The Labeled Company ID you'd like to replicate data for streams you obtained in Step 2.

7. Enter the **Start date** - The date starting from which you'd like to replicate data.

8. **Sandbox** - Turn on if you're going to replicate the data from the sandbox environment.

9. Click **Save & Test**.
